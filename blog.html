                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages
                        interactive
                        (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more
                        advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more
                        functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between
                        multiple
                        computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected
                        to
                        the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                    <h2 class="learn">Learn HTML in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup
                        language.
                        HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the
                        web
                        pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the
                        structure
                        of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a
                        machine
                        can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are
                        human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

                        HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in
                        order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The
                        first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published
                        in
                        1995.</p>

                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to
                        simplify
                        the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More
                        importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It
                        describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In
                        short,
                        you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it
                        behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser. </p>

                    <h2 class="learn">Learn Python in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido
                        van
                        Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an
                        emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in
                        fewer
                        lines of code.

                        Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
                        efficiently.

                        There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.</p>
